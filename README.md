# Online-Machine-Learning-for-App-Prediction
Objective of this project is to decrease response time of the apps by preloading them.

In this project we have used supervised machine learning concept in operating systems.  We are using machine learning algorithm to enhance user experience by introducing a predictive model which can predict the applications likely to be opened next.  Using this prediction, operating system will configure the necessary files in advance and that will reduce the response time of that particular application.Proposed method will learn about application usage behaviour of user and it will provide a personalized service to each user according to their daily application usage behaviour.

As of now, this is in simulation stage.
