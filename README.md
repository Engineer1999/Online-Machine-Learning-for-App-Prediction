# Online-Machine-Learning-for-App-Prediction
Objective of this project is to decreases response time of the app by preloading the app before user select a it.

In this project we have introduced supervise machine learning concept in operating system.  Weare using machine learning algorithm to enhance user experience by introducing a predictive model whichcan predict about the application which user will open next.  Using this prediction, operating system willconfigure the necessary files in advance and that will reduce the response time of that particular application.Proposed method will learn about application usage behaviour of user and it will provide a cus-tomized service to each user according to their daily application usage behaviour.
